# 7-x-0-0beta1 Release is Out! #

I am very pleased to announce the 7-x-0-0 release of the DSS.

The obvious big feature of this release is that it is now compatible with Drupal 7.

The other big feature of this release is the addition of "Special Event" handling, which allows you to handle staffing of one-off type events in addition to the regular repeating events. Check out the video below for a brief tour of the new feature.
