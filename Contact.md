For feature requests/suggestions and bug reports, please use the [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/drupal-shift-scheduler/issues/list).  (Don't be shy!  This is a new project and I'm absolutely looking for any suggestions to make this as useful as possible.)  If there is an issue already on the tracker that you would like to see resolved, you can show your support by "starring" it, leaving comments, helping with the design, and of course, submitting a patch!

If you are using the drupal-shift-scheduler, I would love to know about it!  Please consider leaving a comment with a link to your website or a screenshot of the shift scheduler running on your domain.
